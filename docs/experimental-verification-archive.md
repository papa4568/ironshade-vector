## EV-1 — Acceptance Attack Compiler

Completed 2026-10-09 in advisory/shadow mode.

### Implemented

- Added `agent/tools/acceptance-attack-compiler.mjs`, reusing the existing roadmap adapter to compile a machine-readable attack plan from a real unchecked roadmap task instead of maintaining a parallel task parser.
- Added deterministic templates for false readiness, fake telemetry, skipped quality work, hidden serialization, special-cased test routes, and omitted asset/resource work.
- Added a representative `P28-PLOAD1` attack fixture whose dishonest variants are created only inside a disposable detached clone.
- A verifier success on a dishonest variant is classified as `proof-gap`; it can never produce a candidate pass. Reports explicitly set `candidatePassGranted: false`.
- Hardened isolation after adversarial review: mutation targets must remain lexically and physically inside the disposable clone, symlink/path escape is rejected before write, clone files are not hard-linked to the source, and the clone's `origin` remote is removed before any attack executes.
- Agent Orchestration runs the regression in shadow mode and persists the attack plan/report as exact-SHA advisory evidence. No product/runtime gate consumes the advisory verdict.

### Evidence

Implementation candidate `bd79b1de7c2689ee45278d610ddae2f607d8eca1` passed Agent Orchestration run `37932964656` and PR Candidate Verification run `37932964706` before this archive closeout.

The persisted P28 attack plan had digest `a6ac67d8177ab92d70d43381acd6ae43768c4eabb1900c33e2259c1ac8eece2f` and compiled six attacks from the real `P28-PLOAD1` acceptance contract. Multiple attacks challenged the serialized-placement criterion. The exercise caught the direct hidden-serialization mutation and reported the other five dishonest variants as proof gaps; none became a pass. The report recorded `sourceUnchanged: true`, `sandboxRemoteDetached: true`, and `candidatePassGranted: false`.

Advisory evidence artifact `11617032776` (`acceptance-attack-shadow-347-bd79b1de7c2689ee45278d610ddae2f607d8eca1`) is SHA-256 bound by GitHub Actions as `00e80383af79d99b6be892f4dfda7bc836346f958ad78ce0449fdeeb9cc2b7dd`.

The exact implementation candidate also passed the full repository verification/production build, generated and validated the installable Android APK, passed API 35 product smoke and API 36 large-screen smoke, and passed the aggregate Android and PR Candidate gates. APK artifact `11617099244` is bound to the same candidate SHA with Actions digest `48f04980414b5130ed82572ba24f0216e2d887ae7202326ac57a15d47f94b1a2`. Browser E2E was correctly skipped by the repository's scope detector because EV-1 touched no browser/runtime surface.

### Isolation and rollback

Attack execution clones the source repository into temporary disposable state without local hard links, checks out the exact source HEAD detached, removes the clone's remote back to the source repository, validates mutation targets stay physically inside the clone, resets/cleans the clone between attacks, removes it afterward, and verifies the source repository fingerprint is unchanged. The Agent Orchestration workflow has read-only repository contents permission, so the shadow run cannot push repository changes through GitHub either.

Rollback is to remove the two EV-1 shadow steps from Agent Orchestration and leave/remove the dormant `agent/acceptance-attack-*` tooling and fixture. Because EV-1 does not replace or weaken any existing proof gate, rollback restores the previous verified pipeline without changing product verification behavior.

### Promotion status

Not promoted. EV-1 remains advisory. AO-6 independent-verifier/mechanical-invariant foundations remain a prerequisite before any experimental mechanism becomes default-enforced behavior. The next experimental queue item is EV-2.
